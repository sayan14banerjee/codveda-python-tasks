A simple Python command-line application to **manage your daily tasks**. Users can **add**, **delete**, **mark tasks as done**, and **list all tasks**. Tasks are stored persistently in a **JSON file**, so your data is saved even after closing the program.

  * ⏳ Pending
  * ✅ Done
* Mark tasks as done.
